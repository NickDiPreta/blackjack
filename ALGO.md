## Find Missing Numbers

Create a method called findMissingNums that takes in two arrays. Iterate over the first array and if the number you are iteratring over is NOT present in the second array, push the number into it. Once the loop is complete return the second array.


Input: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [2,3,7,9]
Output: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
